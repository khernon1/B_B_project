 so in my mind, it all looks pretty good
 I think the biggest thing is to clean up the code a bit (delete extraneous spaces,
   delete commented out stuff, fix indentations) and you have maybe 10 methods that
   are a tad long. Break those up and try to have it a bit more legible.

   I dont really know if it's feasible to break up the controllers and the renders
   we had issues doing that and it screwed up our code.
